My RISC-V CPU Project 

I am an Electrical Engineering Junior, starting to this project to explore and learning how CPUs actually work. I know how how to program in Verilog as a novice but I've never made a complete CPU from scratch. 

Goal: Build a working RV32I (32-bit RISC-V) processor over the next 6-7 weeks. 

## Progress

[] Week 1: Verilog Basics Refresher, ALU & Registers 
[] Week 2: Control Unit 
[] Week 3: Single-Cycle CPU 
[] Week 4: Pipelining
[] Week 5: FPGA
[] Week 6-7: Polish and Document 

## Resources 

- Textbook "Getting Started With FPGAs Digital Circuit Design, Verilog and VHDL for Beginners" by Russel Merrick 
- Learning conceptual guidance from AI assistant, documenting my understanding as I go. 

Start: January 25th, 2026
